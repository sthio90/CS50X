1. Approach to Characterize the Audio Aura:
    -Using SQL queries to calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability of the top 100 songs from 2018 in the songs.db database.
    sqlite> SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;
    +-------------+-------------------+--------------+
    | AVG(energy) | AVG(danceability) | AVG(valence) |
    +-------------+-------------------+--------------+
    | 0.65906     | 0.71646           | 0.484443     |
    +-------------+-------------------+--------------+
    -Interpretation based on averages:
        These averages suggest that the listener's "audio aura" is characterized by a moderately high level of energy and danceability, with a somewhat neutral to positive valence.
        This indicates a preference for songs that are energetic and conducive to dancing, with a balanced emotional tone

2. Limitations and Proposed Improvements:
    -Single Year Data: Data from 2018 may not fully represent current musical preferences.
    -Top 100 Songs Bias: Analysis limited to top 100 songs might miss broader musical tastes.
    -Lack of Contextual Data: No consideration of the context in which songs are played e.g working out or dance classes.
    -Subjectivity in Music Perception: Perceptions of energy, valence, and danceability are subjective.
    -Improvement Proposals:
        -Multi-Year Analysis: Analyze data from multiple years.
        -Broader Song Selection: Include more than the top 100 songs.
        -Contextual Analysis: Consider when and where songs are played.
        -User Feedback Integration: Use direct user feedback for aura calculation.
